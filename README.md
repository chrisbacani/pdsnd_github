### Project Title
Bikeshare Dataset Exploration using Python in CLI

### Description
This project focuses on **pandas** library usage and simple statistics methods to perform a rudimentary analysis on the bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities - **Chicago, Washington, and New York City** - to display information such as most popular days or most common stations.

### Files used
The data that powered the project comes from the following datasets:
- chicago.csv : Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the City of Chicago, provided by Udacity
- new_york_city.csv : Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the City of New York, provided by Udacity
- washington.csv : Dataset containing all bikeshare infomration for Washington, D.C., provided by Udacity

### Credits
- [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) : The Pandas documentation was extremely helpful in understanding the implementation of Pandas methods used in this project.
- ["Becoming a Data Scientist" YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFVHt6gpzRxx8BsdSSYDjVQ) : This YouTube channel has been immensely helpful to me. He makes Data Science and Python concepts easy to grasp. It really helps to hear more than one voice explaining these new subjects to me.
- My friends and colleagues in my IBM Apprenticeship were also super helpful to me. Being able to talk things out with people who are also learning it is an extremely helpful learning technique.
- And of course the [Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104) for really helping me learn all these new things in my pursuit to really grow as a Data Scientist.
